Loop invariants are used to find the run time of an algorithm that uses loops.
It involves three main process:
    1. Initialization ( Have a base case )
    2. Competence ( The ability of its program to start true for the second iterationg and all the iterations )
    3. Termination ( The program ends with a required output that is correct)
